                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    After getting my first two Heltec V3 units, I was eager to see what these little devices could really do.
                    I set one up as a base node at home and took the other on a walk, powered by a USB power bank and connected to my phone.
                    As I walked around the house sending messages, I kept an eye out for that little tick mark to confirm delivery.
                    It worked... kind of. But it didn’t give me the kind of feedback I really wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Things improved a bit when I connected the base node to a Raspberry Pi and accessed the Meshtastic web messaging app.
                    At least now, when I got back to my workstation, I could review the messages that had come in.
                    A definite step forward — but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I could do better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s when the idea for <strong>Mesh_Helper</strong> was born. It’s not a replacement for a friend helping out 
                    on the other end, but if you’re on your own, it’s a solid stand-in.
                    This post is about why I built it, what it does, and how it’s already been useful in my own experiments.
                </p>

                <h2>Why I Built Mesh_Helper</h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, I wanted to figure out just how far I could go and still reach my base node.
                    But I didn’t have someone on the other end to help monitor messages in real time.
                    On top of that, I was curious to explore what you could actually do with the Meshtastic Python API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first version of Mesh_Helper was simple — it just looked for a message and echoed it back like a parrot.
                    But soon, I thought: what if I could send it a GPS coordinate and have it calculate the distance from the base node?
                    So I added that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While exploring the packets coming from the node, I noticed they included useful signal information, such as <code>rxRSSI</code> and <code>rxSNR</code>.
                    Here's an example of a raw packet:
                </p>

<pre><code>{
    'from': 3224779633,
    'to': 3224774033,
    'decoded': {
        'portnum': 'TEXT_MESSAGE_APP',
        'payload': b'Test123',
        'bitfield': 0,
        'text': 'Test123'
    },
    'id': 1997213763,
    'rxSnr': 6.75,
    'hopLimit': 3,
    'wantAck': True,
    'rxRssi': -29,
    'hopStart': 3,
    'publicKey': 'oQ8aMsygxQiA************************=',
    'pkiEncrypted': True,
    'nextHop': 156,
    'relayNode': 88,
    'fromId': '!749b7999',
    'toId': '!749b5999'
}
</code></pre>

                <p>
                    With this kind of data available, I thought: why not extract and log it? <code>rxRSSI</code> (Received Signal Strength Indicator) tells you how strong the received signal was in dBm — lower numbers (like -90) indicate weak signals, while values closer to 0 (like -30) are stronger.
                    <code>rxSNR</code> (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) reflects the quality of the signal; a higher number means the signal stands out better from the noise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I had that working, I figured I might as well log everything to a file so I could later compare antenna setups or different node placements.
                    What started as a simple echo bot quickly turned into a useful testing tool — and a fun playground for learning the Meshtastic API.
                </p>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                <p>
                    I love my little Raspberry Pis — they’re perfect for small projects like this. So naturally, I installed and ran the Python code on one of my Pi units.
                    Once it's up and running, I can pretty much begin testing immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now, I've implemented four basic functions. These are triggered by sending direct messages (not broadcasts) to the base node.
                    Even if I believe no one else is on the mesh, I prefer to avoid cluttering the main channel — and if you're doing something similar,
                    it’s probably a good idea to set your mobile node’s Max Hops to 0, just in case.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distance: lat, long</strong> — Copy a set of coordinates from Google Maps and paste them into a message. If the base node receives it, it replies with the distance to that location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Signal:</strong> — Returns the <code>rxRSSI</code> and <code>rxSNR</code> values as observed by the base node.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time:</strong> — Replies with the current time from the Raspberry Pi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Any other message:</strong> — Gets echoed back. This helps confirm reception, and I can later review the logs when I get home.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    All responses and logs are saved locally, which gives me a useful record for analyzing setups, signal quality, or comparing antenna performance over time.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the joy of experimenting. Sure, my code might not be the most elegant. Maybe there are better ways of doing it.
                    And yes, I may have reinvented the wheel instead of just using the built-in Range Test module in Meshtastic. But honestly? That doesn’t matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got to play with the tools I enjoy and build something useful in the process. That’s what I want to challenge you with too:
                    go out and experiment. Try things. Fail a bit. Try again. Learn as you go.
                </p>

                    I hope to hear your stories soon — feel free to share them!
