                <h2>Testing the Summer Vacation Project</h2>
                <div class="row align-items-center">
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>We’re living in an amazing time when it comes to access to technology. In 1992, I began studying 
                        engineering, and once I got through the heavy engineering math, I discovered a love for 
                        integrating software and hardware—or at least experimenting with it. Back then, though, things 
                        weren’t as easy or affordable. I still remember embedding Assembler into my Delphi code just to 
                        access the parallel port and turn on some LEDs.</p>

                        <p>Fast forward a few years (just a few!), and this summer I used part of my four-week Swedish 
                        vacation to build a Meshtastic beacon. Yes, I know it’s still technically called a “repeater”, 
                        but that might change in the future. The idea was to create a node or station that could operate 
                        off-grid, respond to messages from other users on the mesh, and periodically broadcast information. 
                        Ideally, this node could be set up on a fixed antenna at a high location—but the concept should 
                        also be mobile for use at events like field days, scout outings, picnics, or sports events. The 
                        possibilities are endless.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4 text-center">

                </div>
                
                <h2>Hardware Setup</h2>
                <div class="row align-items-center">
                    <div class="col-md-4">
                        <img src="../assets/StadsStation.png" alt="Stadsparken station" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>I started with a Heltec V3 Meshtastic node, which I configured to <strong>CLIENT MUTE</strong> to 
                        reduce unnecessary transmissions and stay within the 10% duty cycle limits. I also replaced the 
                        included antenna with a self-made ¼-wave ground plane antenna. The idea was to focus the signal 
                        more in specific directions—toward areas where I expected other nodes to be—rather than wasting 
                        energy broadcasting in all directions, especially downward.</p>

                        <p>To make the node smarter and more flexible, I connected it to a <strong>Raspberry Pi 5</strong>. 
                        Yes, the Pi 5 is probably overkill for this use case, but it was what I had on hand. The Pi runs 
                        Python code using the <a href="https://github.com/meshtastic/Meshtastic-python" target="_blank">
                        Meshtastic Python module</a>. I gave the Pi a fixed IP and connected it to my laptop via 
                        Ethernet so I could easily update settings or software.</p>

                <h2>Software Features</h2>
                <p>The software (published at <a href="https://github.com/jkpg-mesh/mesh-repeater" target="_blank">
                    https://github.com/jkpg-mesh/mesh-repeater</a>) consists of three main parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meshtastic interface</strong> – Handles communication with the node using the Python module.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web UI</strong> – A lightweight web interface to show mesh status, active nodes, and update configuration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Modular extensions</strong> – Additional functionality can be added easily by including new Python modules.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Core Features:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Periodic Broadcasts</strong> – Sends customizable messages to the mesh at defined intervals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Node Database</strong> – Stores extended info and recent activity beyond the device’s built-in memory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web Dashboard</strong> – Optional web interface to view mesh activity and configuration.</li>
                    <li><strong>Command Handling</strong> – Responds to basic user commands like <code>/info</code>, <code>/users</code>, 
                        <code>/signal</code>, and <code>/distance</code>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extensibility</strong> – Designed to support additional modules and custom services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Powering the Beacon</h2>
                <div class="row align-items-center">
                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>In the field, I powered everything using a “powerbank” setup consisting of a 
                        <a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/se/battery-equipment/b330x/"><strong>Husqvarna BLi300 battery</strong></a> 
                        and the <a href="https://www.husqvarna.com/se/battery-equipment/usb150x/"><strong>Husqvarna USB150X 
                        bidirectional USB adapter</strong></a>. Admittedly, this is not the most budget-friendly option—but 
                        I already had access to the components. It worked great and was able to power the setup for over 8 
                        hours, according to my calculations. I mounted the whole setup on a tripod to create a portable 
                        Meshtastic beacon.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-4 text-center">
                        <img src="../assets/HusqBatt.png" alt="Husqvarna Battery" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
                    </div>
                </div>            

                <h2>Field Test at Stadsparken</h2>
                <p>Of course, this all had to be tested in the real world. So, on the last Saturday of my vacation, 
                    I packed everything up and headed to the local city park—Stadsparken—which also happens to be 
                    one of the higher points in the area.</p>

                <p>It was a great experience. There’s something satisfying about seeing a project come together, 
                    and even more exciting when the first reports start coming in confirming that the beacon could 
                    be heard. Sure, there are a few missing features, and yes, there are some bugs to iron out—but it worked.</p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>In today’s world—and especially within this community—what I built isn’t rocket science. And that’s 
                    exactly the point of this blog. If you’re curious about tech, and you like building things, <em>you 
                        can do this too</em>. Whether it’s just for fun, for learning, or to support your local mesh network, 
                        a project like this is more approachable than ever.</p>

                <p><strong>Give it a try—and if you do, let me know. I’d love to hear how your beacon performs.</strong></p>
