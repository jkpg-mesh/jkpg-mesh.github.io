            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <img src="../assets/Nyarpstugan.png" class="img-fluid rounded mb-3 float-right-image" alt="High point">
            <p>Being a long-time enthusiast of radios and radio communication, I was genuinely excited when I first 
                heard about Meshtastic. I immediately started reading up on the technology and went hunting for that 
                first device to buy. Between placing the order and waiting for delivery, I was already out on a 
                high point with my laptop, an SDR, and a self-made ground plane quarter-wave antenna. I was ready 
                to begin this journey.</p>
            <p>I wanted to see all the activity already happening. I wanted to start chatting with the world... but 
                what I quickly realized was: there <em>wasn’t</em> a flood of messages. In fact, I might have been 
                sitting in an 868 MHz RF pit. Then came another realization: there's a limitation on the duty cycle. 
                And—well—I already have Discord. Why would people want to chat on Meshtastic?</p>
            <p>Maybe this isn’t everything I dreamed it would be. So... now what?</p>
                        
            <h2>Reframing the Purpose</h2>
            <div class="alert alert-info"><strong>What is the ISM Band?</strong><br>
                ISM stands for <em>Industrial, Scientific, and Medical</em>. This band is globally reserved for 
                non-commercial use—like microwave ovens, RFID, and LoRa devices. It comes with restrictions like 
                low power and limited duty cycles to reduce interference.
            </div>

            <p>After that initial burst of excitement gave way to quiet reality, I had to step back and re-evaluate 
                what exactly I was working with here. What are the building blocks of this ecosystem I just stepped into?</p>

            <p>First off, I’m in the ISM band. It's a band where innovation is encouraged, but with trade-offs. 
                In Europe, for instance, the 868 MHz band has a 10% duty cycle, meaning a device can only transmit 
                for 6 minutes per hour. That’s not a bug—it’s a feature, meant to keep the airwaves open for everyone.</p>
            
            <p>So, with that in mind, I realized I hadn’t bought a magic box—I had bought a gateway to a toolbox. Yes, 
                I ordered an integrated radio (the Heltec V3), but what really stopped me from building it from scratch 
                using discrete components? Nothing. In fact, the Meshtastic community is full of people doing just 
                that—designing custom boards, adapting LoRa modules like the RFM95 or SX1262, and even integrating 
                completely bespoke radio platforms.</p>
            <img src="../assets/Antenna.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded mb-3 float-left-image" alt="Testing antennas">
            <p>Then came antennas. My first was a simple ground-plane quarter-wave, but soon I found myself reading 
                up on directional yagis, folding j-poles, and yes—loading a NanoVNA into my AliExpress wishlist (I'm 
                sure we all have that next thing we want to buy). Why? Because Meshtastic makes RF experimentation 
                visible. It's no longer an abstract exercise. You can build an antenna, deploy a node, and see how 
                far a packet travels in real time. That feedback loop is gold.</p>

            <p>Still, I wondered: what data am I even trying to send? That led me to sensor integration. Meshtastic 
                supports temperature, humidity, GPS, and more. And when the onboard MCU isn’t enough to handle your 
                sensors or processing needs—well, why not connect it to a Raspberry Pi and use Python to talk to the 
                radio over serial? Suddenly, it's not just about messaging—it's about building IoT-style networks, 
                weather stations, trackers, or even remote control systems.</p>

            <p>At some point, I realized: maybe chatting wasn’t the point. The point was playing, building, learning, 
                and maybe—just maybe—meeting others doing the same.
   
            <h2>“Real” Use Cases</h2>
            <p>That lingering question—“Is there a real application for this?”—kept coming back to me. And maybe 
                it’s worth asking: what do we even mean by real?</p>

            <p>If we define it as “something commercial,” then sure—Meshtastic probably isn’t there yet. It’s not 
                LoRaWAN. It’s not cellular. It’s not a drop-in solution for a logistics company or a smart city 
                project. But real doesn’t have to mean profitable.</p>

            <p>Here’s what real looks like in the world of Meshtastic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Backcountry hikers and cyclists</strong> using it to stay in touch with friends off-grid.</li>
                <li><strong>Emergency response groups</strong> creating low-cost, decentralized comms networks that don't rely on cellular towers.</li>
                <li><strong>Sailors and coastal explorers</strong> running nodes between boats and shorelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Tech educators</strong> introducing students to RF, mesh networking, and embedded systems with a live, hands-on project.</li>
                <li><strong>Tinkerers</strong> tracking solar-powered sensors miles away, all while optimizing antennas and power consumption.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These aren’t theoretical. These are happening right now. And they may not all be chatty networks 
                filled with constant messages, but they’re undeniably real. The value isn’t in how much data 
                flows—it’s in what you learn, enable, or connect by building the network in the first place.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill"></i>
                <strong>Remember:</strong> The 10% duty cycle is a real constraint—especially in Europe. 
                But within those limits, meaningful communication and experimentation still thrive.
            </div>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>So maybe you were hoping to read this blog and walk away with the “real” application for Meshtastic.
            <p>Sorry—but I don’t think there is one.

            <p>What I’ve come to believe is that there are many real applications—and the one that matters is the 
                one you discover for yourself. Along the way, some of those applications might evolve into 
                polished, packaged solutions. Some might become commercial. Others might remain beautifully 
                experimental.</p>

            <p>Maybe one of us tinkering away in our sheds will stumble across the perfect antenna design. 
                Or maybe, without even realizing it, we’ll spark the curiosity of a young girl or boy—who 
                will one day become a Nobel-winning scientist. Who knows?</p>

            <p>The hardest part of any journey, I’ve found, is learning to roll with the punches. For me, 
                it’s not just about reaching a destination—it's about how I get there. It’s about what I 
                see, what I feel, what I learn. It’s about the people I meet—and maybe even those I 
                encourage along the way.</p>

            <p>So yes—that’s what Meshtastic is for me.</p>

            <p>And if electronics isn’t your thing? That’s okay too. Maybe you're into designing enclosures, 
                building intuitive interfaces, creating web dashboards, or simply finding ways to connect 
                curious minds. There’s room for all of that here.</p>
