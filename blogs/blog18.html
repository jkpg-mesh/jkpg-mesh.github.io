                        2025 is done, but its effects will live on into the future. When I started writing my first blog in 
                        mid-2025, it was because I had found a technology that really caught my interest. To understand it 
                        better, I thought: why not write about it? There was no expectation of hundreds of people reading it, 
                        or of starting the life of an influencer. These blogs were really just a journal of my journey.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What surprised me most wasn’t the technology itself, but how quickly it turned into conversations, 
                        experiments, and friendships.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Along the way, I picked up three very interesting people: Gabriel, Martin, and Mikael. On 6 November 2025, 
                        “Jkpg Mesh ideell förening” (a non-profit organization) was born. A new chapter had started.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first question you may have is: why a formal organization? While we were having our conversations, 
                        one of the realizations was that we wanted to contribute to the broader public discussion on how mesh 
                        technology can shape our society. One way of having a real shot at this is by being a formal organization.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From another perspective, having an organization also helps clear up any future tax implications 
                        (Skatteverket), especially if sponsorships become a reality. Additionally, it gives us a structure 
                        within which we can welcome other enthusiasts and help steer an enjoyable environment for all.

                            “The association's purpose is to promote and develop local and open communication technology with a focus on wireless networks, digital infrastructure, amateur radio, and open frequency bands such as 27 MHz, 69 MHz, PMR446, and other free radio bands.

                            Jkpg Mesh works to increase knowledge, community, innovation, and civil preparedness in communication and technology through education, collaboration, and practical activities.

                        <p>
                            The association will be a platform for collaboration between private individuals, associations, companies, and public actors who share an interest in open technology and societal benefit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The association may, within the framework of applicable regulations, conduct amateur radio operations, hold a club signal, and work for access to its own radio frequencies or permits for various purposes, such as testing activities, preparedness, and training.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The association can also participate in projects that strengthen local infrastructure, information security, and technical expertise.”

                        There are still some finer details to be sorted out, but with the capable chairman Gabriel, I’m sure you’ll soon hear more about this.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, as 2026 rolls in, I’m really hopeful and excited about what is to come. Who will join us on this journey? Where will it lead? What new connections will we make?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is my wish that this organization, this site, and this journey become the journal for many enthusiasts going forward. I know for a fact that somewhere out there is a young person (and maybe an older one as well) who just needs the right helping hand to become the inventor of something big. May these blogs, in the future, not only be my journal, but the history book of something great.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        From my side — happy 2026.
