                                <p class="card-text">A while ago I wrote a blog about why I chose Meshtastic as my <em>solution space</em> - a playground in which 
                                                    I experiment, learn, and occasionally fail in interesting ways. In this article, I want to focus more on 
                                                    <strong>why Meshtastic is such a powerful learning platform</strong>, while also pointing beginners toward 
                                                    practical starting points, resources, and real-world solutions.

                                <p class="card-text">For many of you who don’t know me, doing nothing is one of the scariest things I can imagine.
                                                    I tend to stay busy. So over the Christmas and New Year break, with two weeks off work
                                                    (and yes, spending time with family was part of the plan), the question became:
                                                    <em>what will I do next?</em><br><br>
                                                    Over the last few months, I’ve been playing with Android application development, and
                                                    naturally I started wondering how I could integrate that with my Meshtastic units.
                                                    After spending a few hours reading through the Meshtastic Android code on GitHub,
                                                    I came to a fairly quick conclusion: this is solid, well-written code -
                                                    and I am <strong>not</strong> going to rewrite it.<br><br>
                                                    Then I stumbled across a directory called
                                                    <code>mesh_service_example</code>. And that’s where things got interesting.</p>

                                                    my first blog in mid-2025, it was because I had found a technology that really caught 
                                                    my interest. To understand it better, I thought: why not write about it? There was 
                                                    no expectation of hundreds of people reading it, or of starting the life of an 
                                                    influencer. These blogs were really just a journal of my journey.
                    
                                                    What surprised me most wasn’t the technology itself, but how quickly it turned into 
                                                    conversations, experiments, and friendships.  Along the way, I picked up three very 
                                                    interesting people: Gabriel, Martin, and Mikael. On 6 November 2025, “Jkpg

                                <p class="card-text">When I started experimenting with Meshtastic, a few brands immediately stood out:
                                                    Heltec, Seeed Studio, Lilygo, and RAK. These companies offer some very nice modules,
                                                    both as development kits and in compact, ready-to-use form factors.

                                                    However, anyone who knows me knows that I like to optimize. How can I get the most
                                                    functionality and value for the least amount of money? Can I build something that
                                                    is flexible and easily extended over time? These questions sent me down a bit of a
                                                    rabbit hole.

                                                    In today’s blog post, I’d like to share some interesting electronic components I’ve
                                                    come across that <em>could</em> be used for Meshtastic-based projects. I want to be
                                                    clear from the start: I have not used any of these products yet, and this post is
                                                    not sponsored by any of the brands mentioned.</p>

                                <p class="card-text">There’s a lot of excellent information on Meshtastic.org, and that’s the beauty of open-source: 
                                                    the documentation grows as the community grows. Still, many of us (myself included) are the 
                                                    “experiment first, read later” type. Since helping with JKPG-MESH.se, I’ve been thinking about 
                                                    how to make some of the more complex LoRa concepts a little more bite-size.

                                                    and the goal here is simple:

                                                    are a feature included in the Meshtastic firmware allowing users to extend the onboard capabilities
